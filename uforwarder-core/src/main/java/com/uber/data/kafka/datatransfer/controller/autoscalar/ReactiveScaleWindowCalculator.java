/**
 * Calculates reactive scaling window durations based on system load conditions.
 *
 * <p>This class provides adaptive window size calculation for auto-scaling operations. It
 * dynamically adjusts scaling window durations based on current system load indicators to optimize
 * scaling responsiveness and system stability.
 *
 * <p>The calculator implements reactive scaling logic where:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>When system load indicates tight capacity, window sizes are reduced for faster scaling
 *   <li>When system load is comfortable, window sizes are increased or maintained for stability
 *   <li>Changes are based on load thresholds and timing considerations
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Usage example:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * ReactiveScaleWindowCalculator calculator = new ReactiveScaleWindowCalculator();
 *
 * double currentLoad = 0.85; // 85% system load
 * long lastModifyTime = System.nanoTime();
 * Duration currentWindow = Duration.ofMinutes(5);
 *
 * Duration newWindow = calculator.calculateDownScaleWindowDuration(
 *     currentLoad, lastModifyTime, currentWindow);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>This class is stateless and thread-safe.

  /**
   * Reactively computes the down-scale window duration based on system load conditions.
   *
   * <p>This method implements adaptive scaling logic for down-scaling operations. When the system
   * load indicator shows that capacity is tight (high load), the method reduces the down-scale
   * window size to enable faster workload reduction. Conversely, when system load is comfortable,
   * it increases or maintains the window size for stability.
   *
   * <p>The calculation takes into account:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Current system load indicator indicates ratio between capacity demand and supply
   *   <li>Last modification time to prevent excessive changes
   *   <li>Current window duration as the baseline for adjustments
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Load thresholds and timing considerations are used to determine appropriate window size
   * adjustments. The goal is to balance responsiveness with stability in the auto-scaling system.
   *
   * @param load system load indicator
   * @param lastModifiedNano last modified time of down scale window duration
   * @param currentValue last value of down scale window size
   * @return the calculated new down scale window duration
