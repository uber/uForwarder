/**
 * AckTrackingQueue tracks the received/nacked/acked status of a range of offsets for a
 * topic-partition.
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>received means a message is received and has not been processed by the recipient service
 *       yet
 *   <li>nacked means a message was failed to processed by the recipient service and it should be
 *       produced to the retry topic or dlq topic
 *   <li>acked means a message was successfully processed by the recipient service or it was
 *       produced to the retry topic or dlq topic
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>When using correctly,
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>each individual message can be received, acked or nacked separately
 *   <li>there is no data loss
 *   <li>message fetching cannot go too far, the number of unacked message must under capacity
 * </ol>
 *
 * To use AckTrackingQueue,
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>create an AckTrackingQueue for each topic-partition
 *   <li>invoke {@code AckTrackingQueue#receive} to mark an offset as received
 *   <li>invoke {@code AckTrackingQueue#nack} to mark an offset as nacked -- the corresponding
 *       message should be produced to the retry queue topic or dlq topic
 *   <li>invoke {@code AckTrackingQueue#nack} to mark an offset as acked -- the corresponding
 *       message has already be processed correctly by the recipient service or it has already been
 *       produced to the retry queue topic or dlq topic
 *   <li>invoke {@code AckTrackingQueue#markAsNotInUse} to mark the AckTrackingQueue has been
 *       discard, it is used when a job is canceled
